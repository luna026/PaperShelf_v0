# PaperShelf_v0

This is the first version of the app I made on a Saturday afternoon. I am a researcher and wanted to somehow make my paper-reading experience exciting. PaperShelf makes it easier to track papers, create monthly goals, and see the yearly accomplishments. As I am a critical person, I also included a rating part after finishing a paper so that we can review that paper. The novel thing about my app is the 'Random paper generator' - the name might be a bit misleading, but here is the idea: whenever one feels confused about what to read next, we can take help of this random generator, and it will choose a paper from the collection of papers. Other than that, I integrated Zotero so that we can add all our saved papers in milliseconds (we can also add papers manually).
